### **navbar**

- [ ] Change link 'admin/' to be visible only to the users with **superuser** credentials.

### **blog.html**

- [ ] Untill now the only way to make a blog post is to do itwithin django admin/ page. Change it so that say users within staff group can make a blog post.
- [ ] Apply some css to the blog. Either use displa: flex or display: grid... both should work fine.

### **detail_view.html:**

- [ ] Whole this page needs a lot of css.
